# Visual-analytics
This project showcases exploratory analysis using visualisation and simple predictive techniques for 2 datasets: Employee retention and sport analytics.  
The project was done in Google Colab notebook.  
The ipynb files are in 3 parts: "Employee retention", "Sport analytics" and "Visual_analytics". 
The "Visual_analytics" file is a combination code of the 2 datasets and is linked to google colab. You will need to click "Open in colab" to see all the graphs created.
Alternatively, you can view "Employee retention" and "Sport analytics" notebooks and recreate them in google colab to see the graphs.
At the moment, git isn't able to show graphs created by Google colab on git's platform.
